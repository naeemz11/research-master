              TikTok is one of the most popular app in the world. Almost all of us have a TikTok app on our phones. It's great for entertainment, passing time and sometimes it's even good for sharing information. As a regular user of the app, one thing that I've noticed is that once I start using the app, sometimes it's hard to get off. There were many times at night where I've used TikTok and  the next thing I realized that I've spent hours scrolling through the app. This phenomenon isn't only experienced by me. I have friends who completely ruined their standard sleep schedule ever since they started using TikTok. One question pounders upon my mind: Why is TikTok so addicting? Is it impacting people's mental health without them realizing? I'm hoping to find the answers throughout this research.
