<h2>Research Findings </h2>

<ol>
    <li>“Design of the platform can help to trigger related psychological states (e.g., push notifications can trigger fear of missing out, hence, not being connected to significant others)”(Montag, 2021).
    </li>
    <li>"TikTok attracts very young users, being more vulnerable to detrimental aspects of social media use"(Montag,  2021).
    </li>
    <li>
        “As of November 2020, 800 million monthly users have been reported1, and 738 million first-time installs in 2019 have been estimated”(Montag, 2021).
    </li>
    <li>
        “32.5% of the US users are 19 years old and younger.”
    </li>
    <li>
        “TikTok use (addictive-like behavior), but this aspect relating to TikTok use is understudied. Nevertheless, reinforcement of TikTok usage is also very likely reached by design-elements such as “Likes”, personalized and endless content available. TikTok's “For You”-Page (the landing page) learns quickly via artificial intelligence what users like, which likely results in longer TikTok use than a user intended, which may cause smartphone TikTok-related addictive behavior” (Montag, 2021).
    </li>
    <li>
        “First, there is strong evidence to suggest that poor sleep can increase the likelihood of depression and anxiety (Benitez & Gunstad, 2012). Benitez and Gunstad (2012) found that poor sleep quality increased levels of depression and anxiety in undergraduate students. Woods and Scott (2016) found a significant link between night-time social media use and poor sleep. Additionally, night-time use of social media was connected to lower self-esteem. Similarly, Levenson et al. (2016) measured social media use and its impact on sleep and found that higher levels of social media use significantly increased the chance of poor sleep”(Brougham, 2021).
    </li>
    <li>
        “While having a positive relationship between Self-Esteem and TikTok” (Brougham, 2021).
    </li>
    <li>
        "When it comes to the daily time spent on TikTok, users spend an average of 52 minutes per day on the app" (Mohsin, 2022).
    </li>
    <li>
        "90 percent of all TikTok users access the app on a daily basis" (Mohsin, 2022).
    </li>
    <li>
        "A study observing the behavior of TikTok users in the span of one month shows that 68 percent of TikTok users watch someone else’s video and 55 percent upload their own videos" (Mohsin, 2022).
    </li>
    <li>
        "There were more than 1 million videos viewed every day in a year"(Mohsin, 2022).
    </li>
    <li>
        "TikTok uses a ‘fully-played rate’ indicator (i.e., how many people have finished watching an entire video instead of skipping it halfway through) in order to define platform popularity and trendiness. The navigability affordance is, e.g., reflected by TikTok's ‘for you’ feature that easily provides new content (without having to follow others to see their content)" (Scherr, 2021).
    </li>
    <li>
        "--with swiping up on the screen being the predominant navigation in order to access an algorithmically determined, virtually endless stream of content facilitating the users' motive for escapism"(Scherr, 2021).
    </li>
    <li>
        "--share their subjective ratings of platform content (i.e., likes), which, in turn, feeds into the algorithms that decide about the content in a user's individual profile feed" (Scherr, 2021).
    </li>
    <li>
        "Finally, there is early anecdotal evidence that TikTok impacts sleep behavior and the platform itself recently warned its users not to overuse the app, especially at night" (Scherr, 2021).
    </li>
    <li>
        "--possibly higher use at night. “to the extent that the app itself warned its users about nighttime over-use” (Scherr, 2021).
    </li>

    <li>
        "motive of use: 
        <ul>
            <li>TikTok's feature of self-generating and uploading content that might grab the attention of other users and evoke reactions (e.g., comments, “likes”)—a socially rewarding and valued gratification for TikTok users.</li>
            <li>
                The second motivation, trendiness, is reflective of the fact that TikTok is seen as a cool new app that is not only exciting to use, but is also used by many others, thus motivating users also to use TikTok
            </li>
            <li>
                The third, escapist addiction motivation, taps into cognitive restoration and captures how TikTok users use the app to get a break from their everyday life and to forget about the unpleasant things around them" (Scherr, 2021).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        "The uncontrolled, problematic use of social media applications has often been compared to addiction (Ryan et al., 2014). We also observed how TikTok users in China used the app for its addictiveness and how they were unable to stop using it" (Scherr, 2021).
    </li>
    <li>
        "It's algorithms quickly learn individual preferences, as they capture not only the users’ “likes” and comments, but how long they actually watch each video. As the clips are very short, TikTok’s algorithms quickly build sizable datasets" (Davis, 2019).
    </li>
    <li>
        "Secondly, on the producer side, AI also helps content creators craft viral videos. It simplifies video editing and suggests music, hashtags, filters and other enhancements that are trending or have been proven popular based on the category" (Davis, 2019).
    </li>
    <li>
        
    "This AI recipe is so effective that experts have cautioned against TikTok addiction. Similar to Facebook and Instagram users, the average TikTok user spends 52 minutes per day on the app. In that timeframe, they may watch more than 200 videos, including carefully targeted ads or offers" (Davis, 2019).
    </li>
    <li>
        "In a way, TikTok soon knows users better than they know themselves as behavioural preferences may differ from stated desires. This drives user engagement" (Davis, 2019).
    </li>
    <li>
        "Excessive use may lead to many psychological problems, such as distraction, poor time management, and reduced learning time (Hong et al., 2014), which are well-known indicators of addiction" (Zhang, 2019).
    </li>
    <li>
        
    "Internet addiction can be described as “a disorder in which an individual’s inability to control his or her use of Internet causes marked distress and/or functional impairment and that furthermore creates psychological, social, school and/or work difficulties” (Zhang, 2019).
    </li>
    <li>
        "Studies have affirmed that addiction may have negative consequences on users’ well-being, such as mental health problems, decreased learning and work performance, and poor interpersonal quality.

    </li>
    <li>
        
    "TikTok provides various special effect filters, fun stickers, and video editing tools to help users spice up their videos" (Zhang, 2019).
    </li>
    <li>
        "The social compensation hypothesis suggests that people with high levels of social interaction anxiety will use online communication to compensate for their anxiety during actual social interactions" (Zhang, 2019).
    </li>
    <li>
        "Lonely people are inclined to be drawn to social media to compensate for the intimacy and sense of belonging that are difficult to obtain from the real world (Ho et al., 2017). Short video apps help people stay in touch with family and friends. These apps also give people the opportunity to gain recognition from online acquaintances, which results in the development and enjoyment of friendship ties. Consequently, individuals with high social isolation may spend extra time on short-form video apps to cope with loneliness and expand social network" (Zhang, 2019).
    </li>

    "Positive:

    Neurotic users are often accompanied by anxiety and frustration and funny short videos help them alleviate anxiety. For non-neurotic users, entertainment content can relieve their work pressure and help them pass the time" (Zhang, 2019).Within a sample of 1,050 TikTok/Douyin users in China, automatic TikTok use was associated with increased daytime fatigue that was mediated by higher levels of cognitive arousal before sleep.
